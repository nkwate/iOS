         <strong>
          Background
         </strong>
         Targeted cancer therapy is an umbrella term for a diverse group of newer antineoplastic agents. <a href="./ff_276.htm" linktype="4" target="_blank">Fast Fact #276</a> focused on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This Fast Fact focuses on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the second major group of targeted cancer agents.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Monoclonal Antibody Development
         </strong>
         Antibodies are generated from a single clone of immune cells, and are directed against one speciﬁc epitope on the surface of cancer cells. MAbs can be derived from mouse, human, or hybrid elements; newer developments favor human-only in order to minimize antimurine inﬂammatory response by the patient and to maximize target antigen speciﬁcity. (1–4) MAb nomenclature reﬂects its derivation: -omab (entirely murine derived); -ximab (human-murine chimera); - zumab (up to 90% human); -mumab (entirely human).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Modes of Action of Monoclonal Antibodies
         </strong>
         Unlike TKIs, the large size of mAbs necessitates that they have activity on cell surfaces where they can induce immune responses against targeted cancer cells or interfere with proteins necessary for cell growth. Targeted activity may be enhanced by linking ‘‘naked’’ mAbs to other agents, including cytotoxic drugs or radioisotopes. They can be used as single agents, or combined with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Side Effects and Complications of mAbs
         </strong>
         Common side effects of mAbs include allergic reactions, infusion reactions, ﬂu-like symptoms, gastrointestinal dis- tress with nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, hypotension, skin rashes, and cytopenias. Premedicating patients with acetaminophen, antihistamines, steroids, and nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs prior to mAb administration is a standard part of treatment to prevent infusion reactions. (5) Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are treated using routine supportive strategies. Important drug-speciﬁc side effects are outlined below (6,7) (see Table 1).

         <strong>
          Management of Speciﬁc Side Effects
         </strong>
         <br /><em>Cardiovascular</em><br />
         <ul>
         	<li><strong>Congestive heart failure (CHF).</strong> Monitoring cardiac function by close physical examination, laboratory as- sessment, EKGs, and serial echocardiograms is indi- cated with some of the mAbs (e.g., trastuzumab) and in symptomatic patients. Standard treatment of CHF with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and/or aldo- sterone receptor blockers is indicated. A left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% usually precludes starting or continuing many mAbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypertension.</strong> As with TKIs, mild to moderate hyper- tension requires only observation. For moderate to severe hypertension, no speciﬁc drug guidelines exist and the hypertension is treated empirically. If hypertension cannot be managed, mAb treatment is discontinued.</li>
            <li><strong>Thromboembolism.</strong> A complication of vascular endo- thelial growth factor (VEGF) mAb therapy (e.g., bev- acizumab), risk factors include age >65 and a history of thromboembolic events. Some clinicians empirically use aspirin to try to prevent thromboembolism. (8)</li>
            </ul>
         <br /><em>Dermatologic</em><br />
         Available studies suggest skin toxicities from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (e.g., panitumumab, cetuximab) are more severe than from TKIs. However, evidence-based prevention or management guidelines do not exist.9Tetracyclines are often employed for management of acneiform rash. <br />
         <br /><em>Hypersensitivity reactions</em><br />
		Immediate discontinuation of the infusion and adminis- tration of oxygen, intravenous normal saline to prevent/treat hypotension, and intravenous antihistamines are indicated. Subcutaneous or intravenous epinephrine, inhaled beta-agonists to address potential bronchospasms, and intravenous cortico- steroids may be required in severe cases or anaphylaxis.
