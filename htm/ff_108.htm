          What is Music Therapy?
         </b>
         Music therapy uses the properties of music – sounds, rhythm, and personal attachment and universality of songs – for psychosocial and spiritual support and to complement other palliative care treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Who are Music Therapists?
         </b>
         Most music therapists have Bachelor and Masters Degrees in music therapy and receive training in music, behavioral science, and basic medical knowledge. They are certified by the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT). Those who pass the national music therapy certification examination earn the credential ‘Music Therapist-Board Certified’ (MT-BC).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          What do Music Therapists Do?
         </b>
         Music therapists develop specific treatment goals based on the patient and family’s input and feedback from the multidisciplinary team. Techniques include singing, listening to music, playing instruments, lyric analysis, music-prompted reminiscence, songwriting, improvisation, and guided imagery with music.

         <b>
          What are the Indications and Contraindications for Music Therapy?
         </b>
         Depression, anger, pain, anxiety, insomnia, nausea/ vomiting, boredom, loneliness, and confusion can be treated with music therapy; the only contraindication is patient preference.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          What Type of Patient Benefits From Music Therapy?
         </b>
         Music therapy significantly improved the quality-of-life of cancer patients compared to a control group not receiving music therapy; the benefits persisted as illness progressed. Pediatric patients may benefit from music therapy; music brings normalcy to an ill child’s otherwise complicated life. They may be able to play or hear their favorite songs or continue playing instruments they played before they became sick.
