          Background
         </b>
         54,000 American veterans die each month and account for one quarter of all US deaths. Inquiring about military service has both practical and therapeutic benefits. Hospice care is now a covered benefit for all enrolled veterans and the Veterans Administration will purchase hospice services from local communities it serves. Military service can be a core experience in defining the way veterans live and the way they die. Knowing the components of a military history can be a useful tool in bridging the silence that often surrounds the war experience and can act as a catalyst for discussions about end of life preferences. Establishing an environment of trust is critical when speaking with war veterans about end of life care. A polite inquiry about military service is a good way to create an atmosphere of respect, keeping in mind that not all veterans will want to speak with you about the details of their war experience. Because a discussion of combat experiences can reactivate deeply buried issues, it is important to make this known to the veteran and ask if he/she wishes to proceed.

         If the veteran experiences significant anxiety and needs psychological assistance, or if you would like guidance, you can contact your local VA Medical Center to access their mental health clinics, trauma recovery clinics, or Vet Centers.
