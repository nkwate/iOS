          Background
         </b>
         54,000 American veterans die each month and account for one quarter of all US deaths. Inquiring about military service has both practical and therapeutic benefits. Hospice care is now a covered benefit for all enrolled veterans and the Veterans Administration will purchase hospice services from local communities it serves. Military service can be a core experience in defining the way veterans live and the way they die. Knowing the components of a military history can be a useful tool in bridging the silence that often surrounds the war experience and can act as a catalyst for discussions about end of life preferences. Establishing an environment of trust is critical when speaking with war veterans about end of life care. A polite inquiry about military service is a good way to create an atmosphere of respect, keeping in mind that not all veterans will want to speak with you about the details of their war experience. Because a discussion of combat experiences can reactivate deeply buried issues, it is important to make this known to the veteran and ask if he/she wishes to proceed.
