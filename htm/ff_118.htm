          Background
         </b>
         Near death awareness (NDA) is a term to describe a dying person’s experiences of the dying process. Information comes from broadly reported anecdotes. Patients appear to describe what dying is like and what they need for a peaceful death. The language patients use to communicate NDA may be symbolic. If caretakers are not aware that NDA can occur, patients may be treated condescendingly, ignored, or inappropriately medicated for delirium. Family, friends, and health professionals may respond with annoyance, frustration or fear. This, in turn, may cause isolation, suffering, and impair the dying person’s ability to communicate meaningful experiences at the end of life.

          NDA vs. Delirium
         </b>
         The distinction between NDA and delirium can be difficult; NDA communications, such as reports of patients seeing and speaking to dead relatives, can be misinterpreted as delirium. Delirium presents with deficits in orientation, attention, and short-term memory and should be assessed carefully and treated appropriately.

          Near Death Phenomena
         </b>
         The recognition of NDA requires attentive listening. Health professionals, family, friends and caregivers can help decipher NDA messages. Two broad categories of messages have been described.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Attempts to describe what dying is like:
          <ul>
           <li>
            Communicating with or experiencing the presence of someone who is not alive.
           </li>
           <li>
            Preparing for travel or a change.
           </li>
           <li>
            Describing a place they can see in another realm.
           </li>
           <li>
            Knowing when death will occur.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
          Requests for something to ensure a peaceful death:
          <ul>
           <li>
            Achieve closure in a personal or spiritual relationship, or in an ethical matter..
           </li>
           <li>
            Remove a barrier to achieving closure.
           </li>
           <li>
            Prepare for death via specific items or rituals.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
        </ul>

         <b>
          Pearls for Listening for NDA Phenomena
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Evaluate for causes of delirium and treat when appropriate. Be careful to evaluate for agitation arising from a message not being understood or addressed.
         </li>
         <li>
          Gently ask patient about messages you do not understand.
         </li>
         <li>
          Accept and validate what the patient is telling you; do not challenge or argue.
         </li>
         <li>
          Be honest when you do not understand, but let patient know you will keep trying.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you do not know what to say, say nothing – but be present.
         </li>
        </ul>

          Health Professional Responses to NDA Phenomena
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Help the patient find closure, relieve suffering and anxiety, and help the patient achieve a peaceful, fulfilling death.
         </li>
         <li>
          Help families, friends and health professionals gain comfort and important knowledge about dying.
         </li>
         <li>
          Lessen our own fears about dying.
         </li>
        </ul>
