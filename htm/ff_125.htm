                                    The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS)
                                </strong>
                                uses five observer-rated domains correlated to the Karnofsky Performance Scale (100-0). The PPS is a reliable and valid tool and correlates well with actual survival and median survival time for cancer patients. It has been found useful for purposes of identifying and tracking potential care needs of palliative care patients, particularly as these needs change with disease progression. Large validation studies are still needed, as is analysis of how the PPS does, or does not, correlate with other available prognostic tools and commonly used symptom scales.
