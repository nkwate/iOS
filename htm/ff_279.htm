          Background
         </strong>
         The use of cannabis (marijuana) for medical purposes has become legalized in many U.S. states and Canada. This <em>Fast Fact</em> reviews the use of plant-based cannabis preparations to treat symptoms associated with advanced illness. <a href="./ff_093.htm">Fast Fact #93</a> reviewed the use of prescription single molecule cannabinoid medications.

          Legal Issues
         </strong>
         A number of countries have implemented pharmacy stocking and dispensing systems for herbal cannabis and/or oral cannabis extracts, available to patients by prescription. Nabiximols (Sativex&reg;), a speciﬁc cannabis extract made by combining liquid CO2 extracts of two strains of herbal cannabis, has been approved for prescription use in multiple countries for a variety of symptom indications. Cannabis is an ‘‘investigational new drug’’ in the United States. It is classiﬁed as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, making federally legal prescribed use by patients extremely rare and only under investigational circumstances. In recent decades, however, an increasing number of U.S. states have legalized cannabis for medical use. Since 2012, some states have legalized it for recreational/unrestricted personal use by adults. State medical cannabis programs allow authorized patients to obtain cannabis from dispensaries, and others allow personal or collective cultivation for medicinal use. In all states with the exception of California and Massachusetts, patients who qualify for medical cannabis must have prespeciﬁed chronic, debilitating, or terminal illness diagnoses; however, in no state is cannabis considered an FDA-approved treatment for any medical condition. Providers must be familiar with their own state’s laws and regulatory climate around authorizing cannabis use. (1)

          Pharmacology
         </strong>
         There are a large number of cannabis strains used medicinally; each may vary by morphology, odor, and chemotype, producing plant resin with varying ratios of pharmacologically active cannabinoids, principally tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), terpenoids, ﬂavonoids, and other molecules. Although other receptors play a role, the majority of the effects of THC from cannabis are mediated through partial agonism of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors. (2) Cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) are part of the en- docannabinoid system, a prohomeostatic modulatory system composed of several endogenous ligands. (3) Physiologically, the endocannabinoid signalling system (ECS) has been shown to impact pain perception, movement, appetite, aversive memory extinction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (stress) axis modulation, immune function, mood, inﬂammation, and others. (4) THC is excreted via both hepatic and renal mecha- nisms. No speciﬁc studies have been done with cannabis-based medicines in patients with signiﬁcant hepatic or renal im- pairment, but it can be expected that effects would be more exaggerated or prolonged in these settings. (5) Given that can- nabinoids are highly protein bound in the plasma, it is unlikely they will be effectively removed by hemodialysis. (6)

          Dosing
         </strong>
         Exact dosages depend on individual patient need and tolerance of side effects. Cannabis preparations include resincontaining herbal ﬂowers, which can be heated and delivered to the lungs via inhalation of smoke or vapor, and cannabis-based extracts, which include oral, oromucosal, rectal, and topically delivered preparations in the form of concentrates, suppositories, edibles, and salves. Because cannabinoids are volatile, they will vaporize at a temperature much lower than actual combustion, and can be inhaled without the generation of potentially harmful smoke. (7) Cannabinoids are lipophilic and have nearly immediate onset of action when smoked or vaporized. Vaporization has the advantage of rapid onset of effect and easy dose titration, as the patient can slowly increase use to achieve desired therapeutic effect. Patients can be advised to pause brieﬂy between inhalations to ascertain effectiveness of the medicine and to stop when maximum effect is achieved. Oral ingestion of cannabis products has a delayed onset of action compared to inhalation and titration is more difﬁcult. Maximum cannabinoid blood levels are reached up to six hours post oral ingestion, with a half-life of 20 to 30 hours. (4)

          Side Effects/Risks
         </strong>
         Cannabis use can cause xerostomia, palpitations, ﬂushing, nausea, confusion, anxiety, dysphoria, and acute toxic psychosis. Cannabis ingestion raises the risk of a motor vehicle accident. (8) Epidemiological data from nonmedical settings suggest an association between chronic cannabis use history and schizophrenia, but the causal direction of this link has not been established. (9,10)

          Indications
         </strong>
         Over the last several decades cannabis and cannabinoid therapeutics have been studied in over 100 controlled clinical trials of varying size and quality, investigating a wide range of conditions. (11) As with the evidence base for most pharmacologic symptom interventions, there are a lack of comparative data between cannabis and other commonly used treatments for example for spasticity or neuropathic pain. Of relevance to palliative care settings, (12–15) cannabis medicines, both orally administered and inhaled, have been shown to have efﬁcacy in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) for a number of symptoms. For cancer pain, a multicenter RCT, involving 360 patients, investigated oral cannabis to treat breakthrough cancer pain in subjects who were started on a long-acting opioid. It showed analgesic efﬁcacy in the low and medium dose ranges, which were also well tolerated. (16) Three RCTs, involving 43 subjects in total, investigating inhaled cannabis for nausea and vomiting secondary to active cancer chemotherapy, demonstrated inhaled cannabis to be an efﬁcacious antiemetic. (17–19) For multiple sclerosis, numerous symptoms—spasticity, both objective and subjectively assessed, spasm frequency, insomnia, pain, as well as impaired mobility—were shown to be improved in a 630-subject multicenter RCT over a 12-month period. (20) Three RCTs of inhaled cannabis involving 107 subjects in total congruently showed efﬁcacy for appetite stimulation and weight gain in patients with AIDS wasting syndromes, (21–23) and two RCTs of inhaled cannabis for painful HIV sensory neuropathy involving 89 subjects in total both showed signiﬁcant analgesic efﬁcacy, (24,25) with a combined number-needed-to-treat of 3.38, superior to all other medications similarly tested for this indication. (26) Three additional RCTs involving 100 subjects in total—of inhaled cannabis for chronic, intractable neuropathic pain due to multiple etiologies—all congruently showed efﬁcacy for smoked and vaporized cannabis. (27–29)
