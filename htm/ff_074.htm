          Scenario 1: Episodic (non-continuous) moderate-to-severe pain
         </b>
         <br/>
         <b>
          Bad Example:
         </b>
         <i>
          ‘Oxycodone w/ acetaminophen (Percocet), 1-2 PO q 4-6hour PRN severe pain, and acetaminophen w/codeine (Tylenol #3) 1-2 PO q4-6 PRN moderate pain.’

          Discussion
         </b>
         This order has several problems.
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The duration of short-acting opioids is typically 3-4 hours - rarely 6 hours. Studies document that when given a range, nurses and doctors are most likely to give the lowest dose at the longest interval, leading to inadequate analgesia.
         </li>
         <li>
          Only one opioids/non-opioid combination should be prescribed at a time: assess for response and change to different product if the first agent does not produce the desired effect.
         </li>
         <li>
          The use of descriptors (‘mild,’ ‘moderate,’ ‘severe’) allows for subjective interpretation of pain severity by the nurse, rather than judging pain severity directly based on patient report. There is a very poor correlation of pain ratings between patients and clinicians.
         </li>
         <li>
          Should both drugs be used, there is risk of exceeding 4 grams/day of acetaminophen.
         </li>
        </ol>

          Preferred order

          ‘Oxycodone w/ acetaminophen, 1-2 tabs PO q 4 hours PRN pain.’
         </i>
        </p>

         <b>
          Scenario 2: Order for an oral long-acting opioid
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Bad Example
         </b>
         <i>
          ‘Morphine extended-release 60 mg q 6 hours and transdermal fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hour, changed q 72 hours.’
         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Discussion
         </b>
         This order has two problems. First, none of the oral long-acting products (e.g. MS Contin, Oxycontin, Kadian) should be prescribed less than Q8h; Q12 is the preferred dosing interval. Second, there is no rationale for using two different long-acting products at the same time. Prescribe only one drug, then dose escalate to desired effect or unacceptable toxicity. Remember to always prescribe a PRN product for breakthrough pain. While the oral long-acting products can be dose escalated every 24 hours, the transdermal fentanyl patch can only be safely dose escalated every 2-3 days. Thus, it is a poor choice for poorly controlled pain

          Preferred order
         </b>
         <i>
          ‘Morphine extended-release 150 mg q 12 hours.’
         </i>
         (The dose of 150 mg q12 hours is derived from the following equianalgesic relationships: morphine 60 mg q6 hours is 240 mg/day; transdermal fentanyl 25mcg/hr = approximately 60 mg/day of oral morphine. 240 + 60 = 300 mg or 150 mg q12 hours. See
