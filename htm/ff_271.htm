          Introduction
         </strong>
         Tri-cyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the mainstays of adjuvant therapy for neuropathic pain.  For more information on the use of antidepressants and a more in-depth look at gabapentin see

         reviews the evidence for the use of AEDs in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Due to lack of head-to-head data, evidence is presented as numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH). For instance, an NNT of 5 for 50% pain reduction means for every 5 patients treated with a drug, only 1 of them would achieve a 50% reduction in pain. All data presented and doses mentioned are for adults. Data below are based on investigations of patients with chronic pain. Given the paucity of research about the use of adjuvants for pain management in patients with life-limiting illnesses, many clinicians empirically extrapolate available data to palliative care patients.

         <strong>
          Gabapentin
         </strong>
         is effective in treating central and peripheral neuropathic pain. According to a 2011 Cochrane review of the effect of gabapentin on chronic neuropathic conditions (including post-herpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, mixed neuropathic pain), the NNT is 5.8 (4.8-7.2) to achieve at least moderate benefit. This NNT is more conservative than those previously published due to better definitions of efficacy outcomes and an increased number of participants and studies evaluated. Adverse effects are frequent, usually tolerable and include drowsiness, dizziness and edema (1). Gabapentin should be dose adjusted for renal dysfunction. It should be withdrawn gradually to avoid precipitating seizures. Maximum dose is 3,600 mg/day (2).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Pregabalin
         </strong>
         is effective in treating peripheral and central neuropathic pain. Its effectiveness increases as the dose approaches 600 mg/day. Based on a recent meta-analysis, at a dose of 600 mg/day, the NNT to decrease pain by 50% for the following conditions is: 3.9 (range 3.1-5.1) for post-herpetic neuralgia; 5.0 (range 4.0-6.6) for diabetic neuropathy; and 5.6 (range 3.5-14) for central neuropathic pain. There was no difference in incidence of side effects among participants taking pregabalin vs placebo and no indication of a dose response to side-effects (3). Dosing starts at 150 mg/day in divided doses either twice or three times daily (2).
        </p>

         <strong>
          Carbamazepine
         </strong>
         is effective in treating neuropathic pain, specifically trigeminal neuralgia, but is not considered first-line therapy due to its adverse effects.  A 2011 meta-analysis focused on the use of carbamazepine for chronic neuropathic pain reported that carbamazepine reduced pain compared to placebo (NNT of 1.7, range 1.5-2.0). However, adverse events occur frequently: NNH = 2.6, range 2.1-3.5 (4).  Common side effects include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, nausea/vomiting and blurred vision. Additionally, there is a risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Laboratory tests (BUN, complete blood count, sodium, liver function tests, urinalysis) and serum drug levels should be checked at baseline and during treatment. Dosing starts at 100-200 mg twice a day and is titrated up by 200 mg/day every 3 – 5 days until pain relief is achieved.  Maximum dose is 1,200 mg/day (2).
        </p>

         <strong>
          Oxcarbazepine
         </strong>
         is an analogue of carbemazepine which is equally effective at treating trigeminal neuralgia as carbemazepine (5) but with fewer side effects (6). Oxcarbazepine can be started at 300 mg twice a day and titrated up by 300 mg/day every 3 days to therapeutic effect. Maximum dose is 2,400 mg/day (2).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Valproic acid
         </strong>
         was evaluated in a 2011 meta-analysis for the treatment of neuropathic pain. There were insufficient data for reliable pooled analysis, and the authors recommend against its use as first line therapy (7). Several small studies (n&lt;60) showed benefit of the use of valproic acid (maximum of 1200 mg/day in divided doses) over placebo in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy (8). However, this data is not convincing as other studies of valproic acid have failed to find an effect (9). Adverse effects include liver function test abnormalities, dizziness, drowsiness and nausea. Maximum dose is 60 mg/kg/day (2).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Topiramate
         </strong>
         has not demonstrated convincing efficacy for painful diabetic neuropathy. In three studies totaling more than 1200 participants, topiramate did not show a statistically significant effect on painful diabetic neuropathy (9).  A subsequent smaller randomized controlled trial of 317 patients with diabetic neuropathy showed a benefit to topiramate over placebo with a NNT of 6.9. Serious adverse events thought to be related to topiramate included convulsion and bradycardia plus syncope (10). Additional adverse effects include sedation, nausea, diarrhea and metabolic acidosis (2). Dosing starts at 50 mg/day and can be titrated up to 400 mg/day (10).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Lacosamide
         </strong>
         has weak evidence supporting its use.  In a randomized, placebo controlled study of 119 patients with diabetic neuropathy, patients treated with lacosamide (100-400 mg/day) showed a decrease in baseline pain by 2 or more points on an 11-point scale compared to controls treated with placebo, NNT 10.9. Side effects were similar (12). Subsequent trials have failed to show an effect except for the efficacy of a 400 mg dose in subgroup analysis (9). Dosing starts at 50 mg twice daily and can be increased to 400 mg/day. Of note, abrupt discontinuation can precipitate seizures (2).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Using other AEDs
         </strong>
         including phenytoin and levetiracetam is not supported by clinical research. Although there is not strong evidence to support the use of lamotrigine in treating acute or chronic pain at doses of 200-400mg daily, there a single small study (n=92) which demonstrates benefit for patients with painful HIV-related neuropathy (12, 9, 13).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Summary
         </strong>
         TCAs, SNRIs, and the AEDs gabapentin and pregabalin are the best adjuvant analgesics for neuropathic pain. For patients who are intolerant to or who experience pain unresponsive to the above medications, one can consider therapy with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, topiramate or lacosamide, However, as these agents are associated with more side effects and lower rates of efficacy,expert consultation is strongly recommended.
