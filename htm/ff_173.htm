          Background
         </b>
         While several recent studies have found fatigue to be the single most prevalent, severe, and disabling symptom in cancer patients – exceeding even pain – it remains both underrecognized and poorly treated by physicians (1). This Fast Fact reviews diagnostic and treatment approaches in the palliative care setting.

         <b>
          Characteristics of Fatigue
         </b>
         Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a persistent sense of tiredness/diminished energy related to cancer and/or its treatment, which is not relieved by rest, and which causes diminution in functional capacity and quality of life. Additional proposed ICD-10 features include: diminished concentration; diminished motivation; insomnia or hypersomnia; nonrestorative sleep; short-term memory deficits, and marked emotional reactivity to fatigue that are not primarily consequences of depression (2).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Causes
         </b>
         CRF is often multifactorial, with biochemical, physiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions that remain poorly defined. Assessment is aimed at identifying correctable causes and determining the impact of CRF on both patients and caregivers. Common causes of CRF include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Direct effect from cancer and/or treatments
         </li>
         <li>
          Sedating medications
         </li>
         <li>
          Deconditioning
         </li>
         <li>
          Psychiatric co-morbidities (e.g. depression, anxiety)
         </li>
         <li>
          Hypoxemia, or severe anemia (Hb ≤8 g/dL) and possibly moderate anemia (Hb ≤11g/dL)
         </li>
         <li>
          Systemic infection and/or or significant organ dysfunction (e.g. heart, liver, kidney, lung)
         </li>
         <li>
          Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. ↓Na+, ↓K+, ↓Mg++ , ↑Ca++)
         </li>
         <li>
          Nutritional imbalance/impairment
         </li>
         <li>
          Sleep disturbance
         </li>
         <li>
          Uncontrolled pain
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <br/>
         <b>
          Specific Treatments
         </b>
         Treatment should be directed toward correcting identifiable causes, e.g. elimination of sedating drugs, correction of anemia or electrolyte imbalance.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Non-Specific Treatments
         </b>
         Nonspecific treatments may be helpful in reducing fatigue, optimizing function, and promoting adaptation.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Education: Educate patient/family about CRF in order to normalize the symptom and promote adaptation/adjustment through setting realistic goals; modifying and prioritizing activities; and planning activities around diurnal variations in energy levels.
         </li>
         <li>
          Exercise: Several randomized controlled trials showed benefit of exercise in managing fatigue in patients undergoing active antineoplastic treatment (3). Aerobic exercise (low to moderate intensity; progressive) is ideal, but benefits may be realized with resistance training. A reasonable goal is 20-30 minutes of (cumulative) exercise per day, 4-5 days per week.
         </li>
         <li>
          Drug Therapy: There is little good data for non-specific drug therapy in CRF. The following drugs have been used with variable success:
          <ul>
           <li>
            Psychostimulants: While there is a growing literature on the use of psychostimulants for CRF, there is a lack of good controlled trails. Methylphenidate: small studies have shown some efficacy in CRF, but a recent RCT of methylphenidate, 5 mg po q2h prn (maximum dose: 20 mg/d) showed no difference from placebo at one week (4). Start with 2.5-5 mg and titrate as necessary to 15-30 mg po at 08:00 and noon. Modafanil: pilot studies indicate efficacy in the treatment of fatigue associated with depression, MS, ALS, and HIV. Potentially fewer side effects than other psychostimulants. Start with 50 mg po qam and titrate as necessary to 200-400 mg po qam.
           </li>
           <li>
            Corticosteroids: These may provide a modest duration of benefit (2-4 weeks) offset by the potential for significant toxicity. Reported regimens have included prednisone 7.5-10 mg po qd; dexamethasone 1-2 mg po qd; methylprednisolone 32 mg po qd.
           </li>
           <li>
            Megestrol acetate: Two double-blind, crossover studies showed reduction in CRF with doses of 160 mg po tid (5,6).
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
