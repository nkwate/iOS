          Background
         </b>
         Survival to discharge following cardiac arrest occurring in the hospital is infrequent. This Fast Fact will review data on CPR outcomes in hospitalized patients.
        </p>
        <ol type="I">
         <li>
          The largest and most comprehensive source of in-hospital CPR outcomes data is the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, reporting 14,720 resuscitation attempts (2000-2002) in adults from 207 U.S. hospitals (1). A uniform case inclusion definition was used which included both cardiac and respiratory arrests requiring an emergency response from hospital personnel.
          <ul>
           <li>
            Survival 20 minutes after CPR was 44%, but only 17% of all CPR patients survived to discharge. The survival to discharge for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia was 34% and 35%, respectively, but only 10% for asystole and pulseless electrical activity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pre-CPR, 84% of patients came from home. Among survivors, 51% returned home, the remainder being discharged to another hospital, a rehabilitation facility, or a nursing home. Two percent were discharged to hospice care.
           </li>
           <li>
            Neurological function of survivors was assessed using a five point scale (1 = good performance to 5 = brain death). Pre-CPR, 68% were in category 1, falling to 59% at discharge. In other words, 86% of category 1 patients remained at this level if they survived CPR, whereas 14% had neurological decline.
           </li>
           <li>
            Overall functional performance was assessed using a similar five point scale (1 = good to 5 = brain death). Overall performance declined: 49% of survivors were category 1 pre-CPR compared to only 37% after CPR, a 25% decline in overall function.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
          A meta-analysis of CPR outcomes was reported in 1998; it included data from 49 research publications after 1980, totaling 9,838 patients (2).
         </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Depending on the rigor of CPR event definition, immediate survival was 41-44% and survival to discharge was 13-15%.
         </li>
         <li>
          Only five studies reported discharge information. Of these, 73 of 93 patients (78%) returned to their home.
         </li>
         <li>
          Factors predicting survival to discharge included myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.
         </li>
         <li>
          Factors which predicted a failure to survive to discharge included:
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sepsis the day prior to the CPR event
           </li>
           <li>
            Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl
           </li>
           <li>
            Metastatic cancer
           </li>
           <li>
            Being African-American (this risk factor has subsequently been challenged â€“ see Reference 3)
           </li>
           <li>
            Dementia
           </li>
           <li>
            Dependent status
           </li>
          </ul>

        </ul>
        <ol start="3" type="I">
         <li>
          Historically, the CPR success rate in cancer patients has been thought to be less than 2%. A recent meta-analysis reviewed 42 studies from 1966-2005. Since 1990, 6.7% of cancer patients (localized: 9.1%; metastatic: 7.8%) survived CPR to discharge (4). Survival to discharge for ward patients was better than ICU patients: 10.1% vs.2.2%. Data on neurological outcome were not included.
         </li>
         <li>
          Renal dialysis patients: 3 studies have looked at CPR outcomes in a total of 137 dialysis patients. Survival to discharge was seen in 14% of patients. One study examined long-term survival: of 74 patients undergoing CPR, only 2 (3%) survived six months (vs. 9% of non-dialysis controls) (5).

          Summary
         </b>
         CPR for hospitalized patients is associated with poor outcomes, as the cause of arrest is usually associated with advanced chronic illness rather than an easily reversible acute cardio-pulmonary event (e.g. isolated arrhythmia). When talking with patients about CPR, physicians can say roughly 15%, or 1 in 6 patients, who undergo CPR in the hospital may survive to discharge. However, specific co-morbidities will reduce the chance of survival, and surviving patients are at risk for a range of CPR-related complications including permanent neurological and functional impairment.
