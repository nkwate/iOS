          Background
         </strong>
         When family meetings are conducted with the goal of helping a patient/family cope with a shift in goals from life-sustaining treatments to a more comfort focused approach, communication can break down. This
         <em>
          Fast Fact
         </em>
         reviews the common causes of conflict.

         <strong>
          Recognizing Conflict
         </strong>
         When the patient/surrogates are not psychologically ready to accept the limits of medical interventions or the finality of the impending death, you will hear comments such as these:
         <em>
          There must be some mistake; I know there are other treatments available; We want a second opinion; We believe in miracles; She is fighter, she will never give up; There must be something (medically) you can do.
         </em>
         Health professionals may interpret these statements as 'denial.' But the term denial, by itself, is insufficient to help the clinician understand what is causing the impasse. Understanding the cause is essential in planning an effective strategy to move beyond the conflict to meet the needs of the patient and surrogates.

          Debriefing
         </strong>
         Conflicts are stressful for all involved health professionals. It is helpful to debrief the process - what went well, what could have been improved, and - most importantly - addressing the emotional reaction and needs of the care team. See
