         <strong>
          Background
         </strong>
         When family meetings are conducted with the goal of helping a patient/family cope with a shift in goals from life-sustaining treatments to a more comfort focused approach, communication can break down. This
         <em>
          Fast Fact
         </em>
         reviews the common causes of conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Recognizing Conflict
         </strong>
         When the patient/surrogates are not psychologically ready to accept the limits of medical interventions or the finality of the impending death, you will hear comments such as these:
         <em>
          There must be some mistake; I know there are other treatments available; We want a second opinion; We believe in miracles; She is fighter, she will never give up; There must be something (medically) you can do.
         </em>
         Health professionals may interpret these statements as 'denial.' But the term denial, by itself, is insufficient to help the clinician understand what is causing the impasse. Understanding the cause is essential in planning an effective strategy to move beyond the conflict to meet the needs of the patient and surrogates.

          Information Gaps
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
         <li>
          Inaccurate understanding of the patient's medical condition (e.g. overly optimistic or pessimistic prognosis).
         </li>
         <li>
          Inconsistent information (
          <em>
           One doctor tells us one thing and another something else.
          </em>
          ).
         </li>
         <li>
          Confusing information (e.g. use of medical jargon, multiple treatment options presented without a clear recommendation).
         </li>
         <li>
          Excessive information (well-meaning family/friends/clinicians providing information without full awareness of the problems).
         </li>
         <li>
          Genuine uncertainty (e.g., predicting functional outcome from a brain injury in its immediate aftermath may be impossible).
         </li>
         <li>
          Language/translation/cultural issues (
          <em>
           We never tell someone they are dying in our culture.

            Clinician value of wanting to protect the patient from invasive, non-beneficial treatment while the family values wanting to prolong life no matter how much suffering it might entail.

         All of these issues represent a degree of conflict and will need to be addressed before proceeding to set end-of-life goals. See

         <strong>
          Debriefing
         </strong>
         Conflicts are stressful for all involved health professionals. It is helpful to debrief the process - what went well, what could have been improved, and - most importantly - addressing the emotional reaction and needs of the care team. See
