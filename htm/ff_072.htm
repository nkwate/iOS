          Introduction
         </b>
         This Fast Fact will discuss appropriate ways to write opioid infusion titration orders.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          A bad example:
         </b>
         ‘
         <i>
          Morphine 2-10mg/hour, titrate to pain relief.’
         </i>
         <br/>
         <b>
          What is wrong with this order?
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          This order places full responsibility for dose titration upon the nurse.
         </li>
         <li>
          It provides no guidance regarding how fast to titrate (e.g. every hour, every shift?) or dose titration intervals (e.g. for poorly treated pain, should the dose be raised from 2 to 3 mg, 2 to 10 mg, other?).
         </li>
         <li>
          It poses the potential for overdosage by too zealous dose escalation and provides only one option for poorly controlled pain – increasing the continuous infusion rate.
         </li>
         <li>
          Given that it takes at least 8 hours to achieve steady-state blood levels after a basal dose change, it makes no pharmacological sense to dose escalate the basal dose more frequently than q 8 hours.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         <b>
          A better way to write this order:
         </b>
         ‘
         <i>
          Morphine 2 mg/hour and morphine 2 mg q 15 minutes for breakthrough pain (or 2 mg via PCA dose). RN may dose escalate the PRN dose to a maximum of 4 mg within 30 minutes for poorly controlled pain.’
         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Why is this better?
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          This order is preferred as it provides a basal rate and a breakthrough dose. The breakthrough dose has a peak effect within 5-10 minutes. Thus, if the breakthrough dose is inadequate it can be safely increased, as often as every 15-30 minutes, to achieve analgesia – without a need for rapid upward titration of the basal rate.
         </li>
         <li>
          Reassess the need for a change in the basal rate no more frequently than every 8 hours; use the number of administered bolus doses as a rough guide when calculating a new basal rate. However, never increase the basal rate by more than 100% at any one time. When increasing the basal rate, always administer a loading dose so as to more rapidly achieve steady-state blood levels.
         </li>
        </ol>
