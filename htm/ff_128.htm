          Background
         </b>
         Speech pathologists can facilitate communication among members of the medical team, and between the team and the patient/family, to make treatment decisions that honor patient wishes. Speech pathology services for symptom control to enable the individual to maintain activities of daily living and basic functional skills are reimbursable under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (

         ). Swallowing studies are used to evaluate a patient’s ability to safely ingest oral food and oral secretions, yet the role of swallowing studies to facilitate optimal care near the end of life is not clear. This Fast Fact will review the indications and contraindications for a swallowing study and the role of the speech pathologist.

          Types of swallowing studies

        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Bedside dysphagia evaluation involves an in-depth feeding/swallowing history, oral peripheral examination, and trial swallows of various food consistencies. Bedside evaluation can not rule out silent aspiration.
         </li>
         <li>
          Instrumental swallowing evaluation is performed via modified barium swallow (videofluoroscopy), fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), or fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing (FEEST). All of these instrumental assessments require the patient to be alert, cooperative, and able to follow simple commands.

         <b>
          Speech Pathologist Role
         </b>
         The decision to perform a swallowing evaluation should be made based on the overall goals of care and expected prognosis. Consultation with your speech pathologist prior to ordering an evaluation can help clarify how you will use any new information. If performed, the speech pathologist will evaluate the swallow and recommend feeding strategies which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Appropriate food consistencies.
         </li>
         <li>
          Positioning of the head and neck.
         </li>
         <li>
          Timing of meals and family involvement.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <b>
          Using the Speech Pathologist’s Assessment
         </b>
         Decisions regarding feeding management should not be made based solely upon the speech pathologist’s assessment of swallowing dysfunction, which may be a sign of the final stage of life in many terminal conditions. In addition, feeding tube placement decisions in this population should not be based on the likelihood of aspiration. In patients with advanced dementia and other terminal conditions, feeding tubes have not been found to reduce the incidence of aspiration and can significantly impair the dying patient’s quality of life (
