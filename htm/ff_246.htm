          Background
         </strong>
         Patients enrolled in hospice programs will occasionally be transported to the Emergency Department (ED).  Emergency medicine training focuses on life-prolonging measures and may fail to address hospice as a system of care.  This

         discusses initiating hospice care from the ED.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Why do Hospice Patients come to the ED?
         </strong>
         ED providers should never assume that arrival in the ED equates a desire for aggressive/life-prolonging treatment.  Even when a patient/family requests such services, an assessment is needed to understand the concerns that prompted a shift in care goals.  Frequently such requests arise from fear about the dying process or guilt about prior medical decisions to limit life-prolonging treatments.  Common triggers for an ED visit include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Stress/inability to cope with impending loss of life.  This may be expressed as a request to start a life-prolonging treatment previously used and discontinued (e.g. chemotherapy) or never begun (e.g. renal dialysis).
         </li>
         <li>
          Poor symptom control.
         </li>
         <li>
          Malfunction/loss of a support device such as a gastrostomy tube.
         </li>
         <li>
          Failure of the hospice program to provide timely patient support and communication.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Management Guidelines
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Notify hospice
          </strong>
          staff as soon as possible.  Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, hospice agencies are legally/financially responsible for the patient’s plan of care and all medical costs related to the terminal illness. See

          discussion with hospice staff based on the patient’s goals.  Returning home or a direct admission to an inpatient hospice facility may be the best disposition rather than hospital admission.  At times, hospices can arrange 24h professional support in the home for patients with difficult to manage symptoms who wish to remain home (‘continuous care’ – see

          Summary
         </strong>
         Patient-centered care for hospice patients may be enhanced by emergency clinicians who acquire skills to quickly adapt to a supportive role in the care of a terminally-ill patient.  Recognizing common triggers for the ED visit, using a multi-disciplinary approach with early involvement of hospice, social services and palliative team consults may assist in providing optimal care for ED patients under hospice care.
