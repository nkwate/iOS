          Background
         </strong>
         Patients enrolled in hospice programs will occasionally be transported to the Emergency Department (ED).  Emergency medicine training focuses on life-prolonging measures and may fail to address hospice as a system of care.  This

         <strong>
          Why do Hospice Patients come to the ED?
         </strong>
         ED providers should never assume that arrival in the ED equates a desire for aggressive/life-prolonging treatment.  Even when a patient/family requests such services, an assessment is needed to understand the concerns that prompted a shift in care goals.  Frequently such requests arise from fear about the dying process or guilt about prior medical decisions to limit life-prolonging treatments.  Common triggers for an ED visit include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Stress/inability to cope with impending loss of life.  This may be expressed as a request to start a life-prolonging treatment previously used and discontinued (e.g. chemotherapy) or never begun (e.g. renal dialysis).
         </li>
         <li>
          Poor symptom control.
         </li>
         <li>
          Malfunction/loss of a support device such as a gastrostomy tube.
         </li>
         <li>
          Failure of the hospice program to provide timely patient support and communication.
         </li>
        </ul>

          Summary
         </strong>
         Patient-centered care for hospice patients may be enhanced by emergency clinicians who acquire skills to quickly adapt to a supportive role in the care of a terminally-ill patient.  Recognizing common triggers for the ED visit, using a multi-disciplinary approach with early involvement of hospice, social services and palliative team consults may assist in providing optimal care for ED patients under hospice care.
