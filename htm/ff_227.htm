         <strong>
          Background
         </strong>
         End-of-life goal setting is a key palliative care skill, typically occurring as part of a family meeting (see
         <em>
          Fast Facts
         </em>
         #16, 65, 222-226). This
         <em>
          Fast Fact
         </em>
         discusses an approach to goal setting when the expected length of life is short.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Establishing patient-centered goals
         </strong>
         Here is an example of how to start the conversation (the patient should be given sufficient time to respond to each of these questions):
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          I/we have discussed your current condition and that time may be short. With that in mind –
         </em>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <em>
           What are you hoping for now?
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           What is important to you?
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           What do you need to accomplish?
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           Who do you need to see in the time that is left?
          </em>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Common responses invoke family, home, and comfort; often surviving until a specific future family event/date or visit with a key family member is described as an important goal. Re-state your understanding:
         <em>
          What I hear you saying is that you want to be home, comfortable, and survive until your daughter gives birth – you hope to meet your next grandchild
         </em>
         .
         <strong>
          Note:
         </strong>
         if you believe the patient’s goal of survival to a specific event/date is not practical, it is important to say so and discuss alternative plans.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Recommend a care plan based on the goals
         </strong>
         Once the goal(s) is/are established, you can then review the patient’s current treatments (e.g. antibiotics, chemotherapy), monitoring (e.g. pulse oximetry), planned tests (e.g. colonoscopy), and medications (e.g. anti-hypertensives), and decide which will help meet, or not, the patient’s goals. Anything that will not help meet the goals should be discussed for potential discontinuation. Depending on the specific disease/patient condition, other issues that are naturally discussed at this point include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Future hospitalizations, ICU admissions, laboratory and radiology tests.
         </li>
         <li>
          Resuscitation orders/code status (see

          ).
         </li>
         <li>
          Current/future use of blood products, antibiotics, artificial hydration/nutrition.
         </li>
         <li>
          If present, the potential continuation or stopping of dialysis or cardiac devices.
         </li>
         <li>
          Role of a second (or third) opinion.
         </li>
         <li>
          Exploration of experimental therapy.
         </li>
         <li>
          Exploration of treatment options the patient or family may bring into the conversation.
         </li>
         <li>
          Disposition options to best meet the goals (e.g. home hospice referral).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Note:
         </strong>
         There is
         <em>
          no
         </em>
         need to ask about each option as a yes/no question (
         <em>
          Do you want blood products?
         </em>
         ). Based on what you know about the patient’s goals, make a recommendation about what should and should not be done in light of the patient’s goals, condition and prognosis. If you are unsure, you can explore the issue with the patient/family (
         <em>
          Given that your dad wanted to get home as soon as possible and yet he was also willing to do easy things that might help him live longer, I am unsure whether it makes sense to stay in the hospital an extra day or two to finish the antibiotics. What do you think he would say?
         </em>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          ‘Long-shot’ goals
         </strong>
         If patients are going to pursue ‘long-shot’ or experimental therapy, perhaps even against the recommendation of the treating team, it is useful to ensure the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Reinforce the team’s respect for the decision, and desire to make sure the treatment has the best possible chance of working.
         </li>
         <li>
          Simultaneously try to maximize quality of life
          <em>
           in the present
          </em>
          , including the best possible pain and symptom management and support.
         </li>
         <li>
          Encourage the patient and family to prepare in case treatment is not successful and the patient dies sooner rather than later. Useful language is to say,
          <em>
           I’d encourage us all to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
          </em>
          .
         </li>
         <li>
          Reinforce that the team will not abandon the patient and family even if the decision is not what is being recommended.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Close the meeting
         </strong>
         Following this discussion, restate your understanding of the patient’s goals and agreed-upon next steps to meet those goals, invite and answer questions, and close the meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Discussion &amp; documentation
         </strong>
         Discuss the goals with key staff not in attendance (e.g. consulting physicians, patient’s nurse, discharge planner, primary care provider). Document the goals, preferably using a templated family meeting note (see Reference 1): who was present, what was discussed (e.g. treatment options, prognosis), what was decided, next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Debriefing
         </strong>
         A useful step after every family meeting is to debrief the process – what went well, what could have been improved and, most importantly, addressing the emotional reaction and needs of the care team.
