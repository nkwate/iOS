        <p>
         The most common symptoms related to ventilator withdrawal are breathlessness and anxiety. Opioids and benzodiazepines are the primary medications used; concerns about unintended hastened death are exaggerated, particularly if established dosing guidelines are followed (

         ). There is no medical or ethical justification for withholding sedating medication when death following ventilator withdrawal is the expected goal. However, increasing doses beyond the levels needed to achieve comfort/sedation,
         <i>
          with the intention of hastening death,
         </i>
         is euthanasia and is not acceptable/legal medical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sedation should be provided to all patients, even those who are comatose. The doses needed to control symptoms depend on the neurological status of the patient and presence of drug tolerance (these same drugs are commonly used in routine ICU care). In all cases, a senior-level physician should remain at the bedside prior to and immediately following extubation until adequate symptom control is assured.

          Medication Protocol
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Discontinue paralytics; do not use paralytic agents for ventilator withdrawal.
         </li>
         <li>
          Administer an IV bolus dose and begin an IV continuous infusion of sedating medication (see below). Do not rely on subcutaneous or enteral drug administration as these take longer to work. For children, obtain dosing advice from a pharmacist or pediatric intensivist.
         </li>
         <li>
          Titrate drugs to control labored respirations and achieve the desired state of sedation prior to extubation. Testing the eyelid reflex is a common method of quickly assessing level of consciousness.
         </li>
         <li>
          Have additional medication drawn up and ready to administer at the bedside if needed.
         </li>
         <li>
          After ventilator withdrawal: If distress ensues immediate symptom control is needed. Use additional sedating medication (e.g. morphine 5-10 mg IV push q 10 min, and/or midazolam, 2-4 mg IV push q 10 min, until distress is relieved). Adjust infusion rates to maintain relief.
         </li>
         <li>
          Specific dosages are less important than the goal of symptom relief. A goal should be to keep the respiratory rate &lt; 30 and eliminate grimacing and agitation.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         NOTE: The following regimens are commonly used; all require a bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion. Dose ranges are approximations and depend in part on patientsâ€™ prior exposure to opioids and benzodiazepines. Clinicians should use clinical judgment when deciding on what specific drugs and doses to use. Many institutions have policy and clinical guidelines about the use of opioids and sedatives in these circumstances. Clinicians unfamiliar with the use of these agents in the setting of ventilator withdrawal are urged to consult with an anesthesiologist, critical care specialist, or pain/palliative specialist prior to use.

         <b>
          Regimen A: Morphine plus Midazolam (Adult doses)
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Good for comatose patients or patients with limited consciousness and/or patients with little prior exposure to these drugs (and thus less risk of tolerance).
         </li>
         <li>
          Bolus: Morphine 2-10 mg; Midazolam 1-2 mg
         </li>
         <li>
          Infusion: Morphine 50% of the bolus dose in mg/hr; Midazolam 1 mg/hr
         </li>
        </ul>

          Regimen B: Pentobarbital (Adult doses)
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Good for the awake patient who can be expected to have respiratory distress following ventilator withdrawal.
         </li>
         <li>
          Bolus: 1-2 mg/kg (at rate of 50 mg/min)

          Good for the awake patient who can be expected to have demonstrable respiratory distress following ventilator withdrawal.

         <li>
          Bolus: 20-50 mg
