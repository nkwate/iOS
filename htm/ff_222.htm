          A cornerstone procedure in Palliative Medicine is leadership of family meetings to establish goals of care, typically completed at a time of patient change in status, where the value of current treatments needs to be re-evaluated. As with any procedure, preparation is essential to ensure the best outcome. This

           Solicit and coordinate medical opinions about the utility of current treatments among consultants and the primary physician. If possible, families need to hear a single medical consensus—all relevant clinicians should be contacted and consensus reached prior to the meeting. If the consultants do not agree, then prior to the family meeting they should meet to negotiate these differences and attempt to reach consensus regarding the plan. If there is no consensus, a plan should be developed for how to describe these differences to families.

          Leading a family meeting requires considerable flexibility to ensure that all relevant participants have the opportunity to have their points of view expressed. Though it is useful to have one person designated as the main orchestrator and coordinator of the meeting, the essential skills for making a family meeting successful can come from more than one participant. These skills include:

          A decisional patient can be asked who he/she wants to participate from his/her family/community, including faith leaders; in general it is wise not to set any arbitrary limits on the number of attendees. The medical care team should likewise decide who they want to participate.
          <b>
           Note:
          </b>
          it is important not to overwhelm a family with too many health professionals. On the other hand, a physician from the primary team as well as a nurse and social worker should attend when possible; these individuals can help ensure the consistency of information as well as help deal with complicated dynamics. If the patient has a long-time treating physician whom he/she trusts, this person should ideally be present.

          The ideal setting is private and quiet, with chairs arranged in a circle or around a table. Everyone should be able to sit down if they wish. For non-decisional patients, the clinical team should negotiate with the surrogate whether or not to have the meeting in the presence of the patient.
