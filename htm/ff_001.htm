          Background
         </b>
         : Some degree of loss of cognitive function occurs in most patients in the week or two before death. The typical scenario presented to housestaff is a late-night call from a ward nurse saying, “Mr. Jones is confused, what should we do”. This Fast Fact reviews assessment and management issues in terminal delirium.

        <ol>
         <li>
          The term “confusion” is not an accurate descriptive term—it can mean anything from delirium, dementia, psychosis, obtundation, etc. Patients need a focused assessment, including a brief mini-mental examination. Clinicians should use one of several validated delirium assessment tools to help quantify and document cognitive function.
         </li>
         <li>
          Delirium can be either a hyperactive /agitated delirium or a hypoactive delirium. The hallmark of delirium is an acute change in the level of arousal; supporting features include altered sleep/wake cycle, mumbling speech, disturbance of memory and attention, and perceptual disturbances with delusions and hallucinations.
         </li>
         <li>
          The most common identifiable cause of delirium in the hospital setting is drugs: anti-cholinergics (e.g. anti-secretion drugs, anti-emetics, anti-histamines, tricyclic anti-depressants, etc.), sedative-hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepines), and opioids. Other common causes include metabolic derangements (elevated sodium or calcium, low glucose or oxygen); infections; CNS pathology; or drug/alcohol withdrawal.
         </li>
         <li>
          The degree of work-up to seek the cause of delirium is determined by understanding the disease trajectory and overall goals of care (

          </a>
          ).
         </li>
         <li>
          The drug of choice for most patients is a major tranquilizer. There is one controlled clinical trial of haloperidol versus lorazepam in HIV patients; haloperidol was the superior agent. Haloperidol is administered in a dose escalation process similar to treating pain. Start haloperidol 0.5-2 mg PO or IV q1hour PRN. Benzodiazepines can be used, but may cause paradoxical worsening of symptoms.
         </li>
         <li>
          Non-pharmacological treatments should always be used in delirium management: reduce or increase the sensory stimulation in the environment as needed; ask relatives/friends to stay by the patient; frequent reminders of time/place.
