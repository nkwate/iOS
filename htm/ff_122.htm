          Background
         </b>
         What are the indications for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in the chronically and/or terminally ill and how can one integrate palliative care into the daily interdisciplinary agenda? A good approach is to determine the patient-centered goals of care and then decide if ICU care will help promote or detract from these goals. The use of a pre-admission checklist can be helpful to determine the appropriateness of ICU therapy and to initiate communication about goals and preferences before a trial of ICU care. With use of a complementary strategy after admission, the patient can benefit from a care plan that integrates palliation into the daily agenda and anticipates needs. This Fast Fact will discuss the pre-ICU-admission assessment of patients with advanced illnesses;

            What is/are the underlying chronic fatal illness disease(s)?

            What has been the clinical course of the chronic illness over the past few months/year?

            What was the patientâ€™s functional status and quality of life in the weeks preceding admission?

            What are the acute illnesses and conditions that the ICU might improve?

            What interventions do you expect will be required in the first 48 hours?

              Cure or improve the acute process but the patient will likely have a reduced functional capacity permanently (e.g. large stroke).
