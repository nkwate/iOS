         ) can be used before intensive care unit (ICU) admission to initiate communication about goals and preferences for an ICU trial. An ICU daily care plan checklist can be used to promote palliative care, simultaneously with curative or life-prolonging therapies. The checklist can help clarify the goals of care for the ICU team, consultants, patients, and significant others and serve as a vehicle for quality improvement.

          Address short-term medical progress and goals:
          <ol type="1">
           <li>
            Assess whether specific criteria toward progress has been met (e.g. mental status or ventilator needs). Has there been improvement, stability, or worsening in the past 24 hours?
           </li>
           <li>
            Have there been clinical changes that will impact the patient’s ability to meet desired clinical goals (e.g. new GI bleeding)?
           </li>
           <li>
            Review interventions that may be needed in the next 48 hours and set overt criteria to measure progress (e.g. objective indicators of progress towards ventilator weaning).
           </li>
           <li>
            Use this information to review goals and determine if there are changes in prognosis that can guide you/patient/family in decision making.

            Identify existing or new physical symptoms and psychosocial needs; discuss among team members (e.g. patient depression, family stress).

           <li>
            Develop a treatment plan for each symptom/need for the next 24 hours.

            Identify both ICU and non-ICU resources to assist in care plan (e.g. palliative care nurse, clinical psychologist, etc.) and clarify roles for members of the interdisciplinary team.
