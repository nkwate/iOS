          Introduction
         </b>
         This Fast Fact reviews bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals (radionuclides), which occupy a valuable niche in the palliation of painful bone metastases (see

          Isotopes and Physiology
         </b>
         The three isotopes available in this country –
         <sup>
          89
         </sup>
         Sr (strontium-89),
         <sup>
          153
         </sup>
         Sm (samarium-153), and
         <sup>
          32
         </sup>
         P (phosphorus-32) – work by binding with high affinity to hydroxyapatite in regions of rapid bone turnover near osteoblastic metastases, delivering therapeutic doses of localized beta radiation, with a tissue penetration measured in millimeters. The precise mechanism of analgesia is unknown but is probably not dependent solely on cell kill. Rather, analgesia may also be a function of inhibition of lymphocyte-associated cytokines or alterations in osteoclast and/or osteoblast activity.

         <b>
          Benefits
         </b>
         Analgesia may begin within 3-7 days, but more typically begins within one to two weeks after administration. Analgesia will last from two to six months; treatment may be repeated. Symptom improvement is noted in 60-80% of patients, with complete analgesia in 20-30% of responders. Radiopharmaceuticals may delay onset of pain in pre-existing, clinically silent metastases.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Procedure
         </b>
         The radiopharmaceutical is delivered in the outpatient setting by a single IV injection or orally (
         <sup>
          32
         </sup>
         P only). Administration requires no special monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Patient selection
         </b>
         Patients with multiple painful bone metastases, demonstrated by bone scan and/or plain X-ray, corresponding to site(s) of pain and an expected survival of &gt;12 weeks are appropriate for radiopharmaceutical therapy. Evidence supporting efficacy in prostate and breast cancer is substantial; data for other tumor types are limited.

          Contraindications
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Preexisting myelosuppression (e.g. WBC &lt;3.0K and Platelets &lt;60-100K).
         </li>
         <li>
          Oncological urgencies/emergencies in which radiopharmaceuticals will be of no benefit (e.g. actual or impending spinal cord compression or pathologic fracture).
         </li>
         <li>
          Renal insufficiency (relative contraindication).
         </li>
         <li>
          Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (relative contraindication).
         </li>
         <li>
          Pregnancy

          Adverse effects
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Marrow suppression: Reversible, moderate neutropenia and thrombocytopenia – manifested by approximately 30-70% drop in leukocyte and platelet counts – is a predictable side effect. Depending on the specific agent this begins two to four weeks following administration, with a nadir between weeks four to six. Bone marrow recovery occurs by weeks eight to twelve.
         </li>
         <li>
          Pain flare: Increasing pain occurs in 10-20% of patients, usually within the first week of administration. It is transient and may be predictive of a good therapeutic response.

          Comparative Data
         </b>
         There is little data comparing the three agents. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency sponsored a randomized, single-blind study comparing a single doses of oral
         <sup>
          32P
         </sup>
         (12 mCi) and intravenous
         <sup>
          89
         </sup>
         Sr (4 mCi). Patients were well-matched in terms of tumor type, degree of osseous involvement, and pretreatment pain scores. Partial (&gt;50%) and complete (100%) analgesia responses were as follows:
         <sup>
          89
         </sup>
         Sr: 7/15 and 8/15 patients, respectively;
         <sup>
          32
         </sup>
         P: 7/16 and 7/16 patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in onset/duration/degree of analgesia or functional improvement. Hematologic toxicity was comparable save except that the
         <sup>
          32
         </sup>
         P group had more thrombocytopenia.
