          Background
         </b>
         Virtually all dying patients go through a stereotypical pattern of symptoms and signs in the days prior to death. This trajectory is often referred to as “actively dying” or “imminent death”. Prompt recognition of this trajectory is key for clinicians to provide the most appropriate interventions for both the patient and family.

          2. Time Course
         </b>
         The time to traverse the various stages can be less than 24 hours or as long as ~14 days. Patients who enter the trajectory who are nutritionally intact, with no infection (e.g. acute stroke), are apt to live longer than cachectic cancer patients

          3. Common Family Concerns
         </b>
         Family members present during the dying process often express the following concerns/questions. Clinicians can best help families by expecting these questions, providing education and reassurance (

         ).
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Is my loved one in pain; how would we know?
         </li>
         <li>
          Aren’t we just starving my loved one to death?
         </li>
         <li>
          What should we expect; how will we know that time is short?

          Should I/we stay by the bedside?

          4. Treatment
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Confirm treatment goals; recommend stopping treatments that are not contributing to comfort – pulse oximetry, IV hydration, antibiotics, finger sticks, etc.
         </li>
         <li>
          Communicate clearly to others what is going on. Write in progress notes: "patient is dying," not "prognosis is poor".
         </li>
         <li>
          Treat symptoms/signs as they arise: common among these are: oral secretions (see

           Fast Fact #109

         </li>
         <li>
          Provide excellent mouth and skin care.
         </li>
         <li>
          Provide daily counseling and support to families.
