          Background
         </b>
         Anxiety is a state of apprehension and fear resulting from the perception of a current or future threat to oneself. The term is used both to describe a symptom and a variety of psychiatric disorders in which anxiety is a salient symptom. This Fast Fact will discuss the causes and evaluation of anxiety; a future Fast Fact will address treatment.

At least 3% of patients with advanced cancer and 10% of COPD inpatients meet DSM criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (see below).
