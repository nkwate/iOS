          Clinical Case
         </b>
         You admit Mary, a new patient, to the hospital. Mary has end-stage, metastatic pancreatic cancer. She has not seen a physician since she was given a terminal diagnosis 6 months ago at another institution. She is nutritionally depleted and has an apparent gastrointestinal obstruction causing significant bloating and discomfort. While you are admitting her she informs you that she is curing herself by drinking fresh fruit and vegetable juices. She refuses to discuss advanced directives because she “Does not trust you.”
        </p>

          Patient-centered Interviewing
         </b>
         How might you begin to develop a working relationship with Mary? One strategy is to strive to understand both Mary’s disease and her illness. Disease refers to a biological, pathophysiological process. Illness refers to the patient’s experience. You can assess a patient’s illness experience by asking about 4 dimensions—Feelings, Ideas, Function and Expectations. The acronym FIFE can be a helpful reminder.
