          Introduction
         </b>
         The reflex by families and doctors to provide nutrition for the patient who cannot swallow is overwhelming. It is now common practice for such patients to undergo a swallowing evaluation and if there is significant impairment to move forward with feeding tube placement (either nasogastric or gastrostomy) – see
         <a href="./ff_128.htm" linktype="4" target="_blank">

         . Data suggest that in-hospital mortality for hospitalizations in which a feeding tube is places is 15-25%, and one year mortality after feeding tube placement is 60%. Predictors of early mortality include: advanced age, CNS pathology (stroke, dementia), cancer (except early stage head/neck cancer), disorientation, and low serum albumin.

          The Tube Feeding Death Spiral
         </b>
         The clinical scenario, the tube feeding death spiral, typically goes like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Hospital admission for complication of “brain failure” or other predictable end organ failure due to primary illnesses (e.g. urosepsis in setting of advanced dementia)
         </li>
         <li>
          Inability to swallow and/or direct evidence of aspiration and/or weight loss with little oral intake
         </li>
         <li>
          Swallowing evaluation followed by a recommendation for non-oral feeding either due to aspiration or inadequate intake
         </li>
         <li>
          Feeding tube placed leading to increasing “agitation” leading to patient-removal or dislodgement of feeding tube
         </li>
         <li>
          Re-insertion of feeding tube; hand and/or chest restraints placed
         </li>
         <li>
          Aspiration pneumonia
         </li>
         <li>
          Intravenous antibiotics and pulse oximetry
         </li>
         <li>
          Repeat 4 – 6 one or more times
         </li>
         <li>
          Family conference
         </li>
         <li>
          Death
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Note: at my institution, the finding of a dying patient with a feeding tube, restraints, and pulse oximetry is known as Weissman’s triad.

         <b>
          Suggestions
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Recognize that the inability to maintain nutrition through the oral route, in the setting of a chronic life-limiting illness and declining function, is usually a marker of the dying process. Discuss this with families as a means to a larger discussion of overall end of life goals.
         </li>
         <li>
          Ensure that your colleagues are aware of the key data and recommendations on tube feedings (see
          <a href="./ff_010.htm" linktype="4" target="_blank">
           Fast Fact #10
          </a>
          ).
         </li>
         <li>
          Ensure there is true informed consent prior to feeding tube insertion—families must be given alternatives (e.g. hand feeding, comfort measures) along with discussion of goals and prognosis.
         </li>
         <li>
          Assist families by providing information and a clear recommendation for or against the use of a feeding tube. Families who decide against feeding tube placement can be expected to second guess their decision and will need continued team support.
         </li>
         <li>
          If a feeding tube is placed establish clear goals (e.g. improved function) and establish a timeline for re-evaluation to determine if goals are being met (typically 2-4 weeks).
         </li>
        </ul>
