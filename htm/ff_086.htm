          Background
         </b>
         Methadone is an effective opioid analgesic for severe pain. Because of low cost (a month’s supply may be US $5-10) and apparent efficacy in complex pain syndromes, it is increasingly used as a first-line opioid. It is, in effect, a combination drug – part opioid and part NMDA receptor antagonist – although there is yet to be any evidence from controlled trials that it is a superior first-line analgesic to other opioids. Methods of dose conversion to methadone from other opioid analgesics that account for its dual action were discussed in
         <a href="./ff_075.htm" linktype="4" target="_blank">
          Fast Fact # 75
         </a>
         . A future Fast Fact will discuss different protocols for switching to methadone from other opioids. This Fast Fact will describe strategies for beginning methadone when the patient has not been taking a strong opioid.
         <b>
          Note:
         </b>
         due to its complex pharmacology, physicians unfamiliar with methadone are advised to seek consultation prior to initiating therapy (see

          Pharmacology
         </b>
         Methadone is lipophilic, thus it takes time to develop tissue stores that maintain serum levels. There is enormous interindividual variation in how long this takes. After a single dose there is a short distribution phase (associated with acute pain relief) with a half-life of 2-3 hours and a slow elimination phase (half-life 15-60 hours). Dosing must account for the accumulation of drug over days. It is this accumulation that accounts for most therapeutic misadventures. Liver metabolites are inactive; therefore no dose reduction is required with renal failure. After steady-state is reached, about two-thirds of patients will get adequate pain relief with twice a day dosing.
         <b>
          Note:
         </b>
         a number of drugs will alter methadone metabolism, so there needs to be close follow-up and attention to the addition or subtraction of interacting medications.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several approaches to starting methadone for the treatment of pain. All take into account the long-half life of the drug that leads to drug accumulation over days. The following discussion presents approaches based on the literature and the author’s clinical experiences.

         <b>
          Conservative Approach
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          Begin fixed dose methadone 5 or 10 mg orally bid or tid for 4-7 days.
         </li>
         <li>
          If incomplete pain relief, increase the dose by 50% and continue for 4-7 days.
         </li>
         <li>
          Continue increasing dose every 4-7 days until stable pain relief achieved.
         </li>
         <li>
          <u>
           Breakthrough pain:
          </u>
          use an alternative short acting oral opioid with short half-life (e.g. morphine 10 mg) every 1 h PRN for breakthrough pain and to provide pain relief during titration phase. This dose too may need to be titrated based on efficacy.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         <b>
          Loading Dose Approach
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          Load: Start methadone at fixed oral dose (e.g. 5 or 10 mg) q 4h
          <b>
           PRN only
          </b>
          .
         </li>
         <li>
          Calculate Maintenance: On day 8, calculate the total methadone dosage taken over the last 24 hour period and give that in scheduled, divided doses bid or tid. Give 10% of total daily methadone as PRN drug q1h for breakthrough pain. Instruct the patient to call you if they need to use more than 5 breakthrough doses per day.
          <i>
           Example:
          </i>
          if someone took a total of 45 mg methadone on day 7 they would be converted to 15 mg tid scheduled with 5 mg as the prn dose.
         </li>
        </ol>
