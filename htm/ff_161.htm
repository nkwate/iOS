          Background
         </b>
         Chronic pain is common in chronic kidney disease impacting 50% of hemodialysis patients, 82% of whom experience moderate to severe pain. The absorption, metabolism, and renal clearance of opioids are complex in renal failure. However, with the appropriate selection and titration of opioids, patients with renal failure can achieve analgesia with minimal risk of adverse effects. This Fast Fact reviews recommendations for opioid use in the setting of renal failure and in patients receiving chronic dialysis.

           Hydromorphone

          , as the parent drug, does not substantially accumulate in hemodialysis patients. Conversely, an active metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, quickly accumulates between dialysis treatments but appears to be effectively removed during hemodialysis. With careful monitoring, hydromorphone may be used safely in dialysis patients. However, it should be used with caution in patients with a GFR &lt; 30mL/min who have yet to start dialysis or who have withdrawn from dialysis.

While some studies have shown decreased clearance in renal failure, most studies do not show drug accumulation. Fentanyl is not dialyzable due to high protein binding and a high volume of distribution.

          Opioid Dosing
         </b>
         Given the lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of opioids in renal failure, it is difficult to advocate for specific analgesic treatment algorithms. However, the following guide has been proposed (Broadbent 2003) for the initial dosing of the safer opioids in renal failure.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 mL/min: normal dosing.
         </li>
         <li>
          Creatinine Clearance of 10-50 mL/min: 75% of normal.
         </li>
         <li>
          Creatining Clearance &lt; 10 mL/min: 50% of normal.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The “normal opioid dose” for any given patient is the dose that adequately relieves pain without unacceptable adverse effects (

         ). While opioids can be used in renal insufficiency, they require closer monitoring and constant reassessment to ensure that accumulation of active metabolites does not result in toxicity. This should not preclude the effective use of opioids in these patients.
