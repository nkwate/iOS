          Quick—
         </b>
         what dose of the transdermal fentanyl patch (Duragesic
         <sup>
          TM
         </sup>
         ) is equianalgesic to a 3 mg/hr morphine continuous infusion? Conversions to and from fentanyl transdermal are notoriously tricky, requiring knowledge of the published conversion data, general opioid pharmacology, and a generous dose of common sense. See also Fast Fact #36 on opioid dose conversions.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Step 1:
         </b>
         Calculate the 24 hr morphine dose: 3 mg/hr x 24 hrs = 72 mg IV morphine/24 hrs.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Step 2:
         </b>
         Convert the IV dose to the equianalgesic oral morphine dose using a ratio of:
         <br/>
         1 mg IV = 3 mg oral. Thus, 72 mg IV = 216 mg po/24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Step 3:
         </b>
         Convert the oral morphine dose to transdermal fentanyl. There are two methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Method 1 – Standard Table. Look up fentanyl transdermal in the PDR and find the morphine conversion table. It says that 135-224 mg of morphine per 24 hours = 50 mcg/hr patch. Note: this range of morphine is very broad which may result in significant under dosing.
         </li>
         <li>
          Method 2 - Alternate Formula. In 2000, Brietbart, et al published an alternative method, based on the results of a multi-center trial by Donner, et al, that relied on a fixed dose conversion ratio to calculate the fentanyl transdermal dose. Brietbart recommended the ratio of:
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
         o 2 mg oral morphine/24 hr = 1 mcg/hr of transdermal fentanyl—rounded to the nearest patch size. In the case example above, 216 mg of oral morphine per day is approximately equianalgesic to the 100 mcg/hr fentanyl patch.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Note:
         </b>
         using this formula, 25 mcg/hr of transdermal fentanyl is roughly equivalent to 50 mg oral morphine/24 hours. This dose may be excessive when used in an opioid naïve patient, particularly the elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Key Considerations
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          All equianalgesic ratios/formulas are approximations; clinical judgment is needed when making dose or drug conversions.
         </li>
         <li>
          The risk of sedation/respiratory depression with transdermal fentanyl is probably increased in the elderly or patients with liver and renal impairment due to its long half-life, thus, choose the lower end of the dosing spectrum.
         </li>
         <li>
          When in doubt, go low and slow, using prn breakthrough doses generously while finding the optimal dosage of a long-acting drug.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         <b>
          Other teaching points about Duragesic:
         </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Start at the lowest dose, 12 mcg/hr, in an opioid naïve patient; there is no maximum dose.
         </li>
         <li>
          Therapeutic blood levels are not reached for 13-24 hours after patch application and drug will be continue to be released into the blood for at least 24 hours after patch removal.
         </li>
         <li>
          Opioid withdrawal symptoms can occur during dose conversions—care must be taken to avoid this by use of breakthrough opioids.
         </li>
         <li>
          Some patients will need to have their patches changed every 48 hours.
         </li>
         <li>
          The recommended upward dose titration interval is no more frequently than every 72 hours.
         </li>
         <li>
          Place patches on non-irradiated, hairless skin.
         </li>
         <li>
          Direct heat applied over the patch can increase drug absorption with increased toxic effects.
         </li>
         <li>
          There are no data that cachectic patients have reduced efficacy due to loss of subcutaneous fat
         </li>
        </ul>
