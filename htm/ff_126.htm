         <b>
          Background
         </b>
         The inability of cognitively impaired patients to communicate information about pain places them at high risk for inadequate pain control. Two common risk groups in palliative care include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Patients with underlying brain pathology such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, or developmental abnormalities (

          </a>
          ).
         </li>
         <li>
          Patients receiving sedating medications such as ICU patients receiving sedative/hypnotics to control anxiety/agitation from mechanical ventilation.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <b>
          General Strategies
         </b>
         Recommended strategies to assess pain in these patients include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Ask the patient: many patients who appear cognitively impaired may still be able to provide useful information concerning pain.
         </li>
         <li>
          Interview the caregivers and family: patterns of particular behaviors may have developed that indicate pain (e.g. placing a hand on the forehead for headache).
         </li>
         <li>
          Review the medical record for known pain-inducing pathology: for instance a diabetic patient with painful neuropathy that was manifest when the patient was cognitively intact.
         </li>
         <li>
          Complete a physical examination and directed laboratory studies to assess for common pain-inducing problems (e.g. fracture, urinary tract infection).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <b>
          Pain Scales
         </b>
         In addition to these measures, clinicians should use a validated pain rating system for the cognitively impaired. Such rating systems focus on the following observational items:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Facial expression
         </li>
         <li>
          Body posture
         </li>
         <li>
          Vocalizations
         </li>
         <li>
          Appetite
         </li>
         <li>
          Interactivity
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Representative examples of pain rating scales for the cognitively impaired, along with background information concerning validation studies and clinical experience can be found at:

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         To date, there are no trials comparing these different instruments. Thus, clinicians should choose one tool and use it consistently to ensure uniformity among health care providers and across shifts.
