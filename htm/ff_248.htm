           <li style="margin-left: 20px">
            Sedation occurs in 20-60% of patients (2), usually during opioidinitiation or around the time of dose increases. Mild-to-moderate sedation usually resolves in a few days; if persistent, it may improve with drug therapy (4).Moderate-to-severe sedation responds to dose reduction, but may also necessitate opioid rotation.

            Encourage patients to accept mild sedation (e.g. noticeable drowsiness, falling asleep unintentionally during relaxing activities such as watching TV or reading) for a few days as long as they are in a safe environment. Moderate (falling asleep during stimulating activities such as eating or having a conversation) or severe sedation should prompt a call to you immediately to discuss next steps.

         <strong>
          Driving Safety
         </strong>
         There are no large, randomized studies directly examining the risk of driving while on opioids (6). Opioids can slow reaction time, cause drowsiness, or cloud judgment when they are first started or increased (7). Most experts agree that driving or operating heavy machinery is unsafe and should be avoided until a stable dose has been reached (8). Multiple smaller studies suggest that many patients on chronic opioids (defined as no dosechange within the last week) have no increased risk of motor vehicle collisions compared to the general population and no reduction in concentration or perception compared to controls(9). According to one study, which videotaped patients while actually driving, those on chronic opioid therapy versus healthy controls displayed neither a difference in driving errors in community or obstacle course driving nor in tests of attention (10).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Counseling bottom line:
         </strong>
         patients who have been on a stable dose for a week, who feel no cognitive changes (drowsiness, ‘fuzziness,’ difficulties in concentrating) can drive.
        </p>
        <p>
         For
         <strong>
          commercial driving
         </strong>
         , the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration generally prohibits opioid use, but with the caveat that these rules “do not apply to the possession or use of a substance administered to a driver by or under the instructions of a licensed medical practitioner…who has advised the driver that the substance will not affect the driver's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle” (11).Individual states, employers, and insurance agencies may have further restrictions, and patients should be advised to investigate these prior to driving commercially.
