          Background
         </b>
         At some point during the course of a terminal illness, a meeting between health care professionals and the patient/family is usually necessary to review the disease course and develop end-of-life goals of care. Learning the process steps of a Family Conference are an important skill for physicians, nurses and others who are in a position to help patients and families reach consensus on end-of-life planning.

        <ol>
         <li>
          <b>
           Why are you meeting?
          </b>
          Clarify conference goals in your own mind. What do you hope to accomplish?
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>
           Where:
          </b>

         <li>
          <b>
           Who:
          </b>
          Patient (if capable to participating); legal decision maker/health care power of attorney; family members; social support; key health care professionals.

          </b>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Introduce self &amp; others; review meeting goals; clarify if specific decisions need to be made.
           </li>
           <li>
            Establish ground rules: each person will have a chance to ask questions and express views; no interruptions; identify legal decision maker; and describe importance of supportive decision making.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you are new to the patient/family, spend time seeking to know the “person”—ask about hobbies, family, what is important in her or his life, etc.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>
           Determine what the patient/family already knows.
          </b>
          Tell me your understanding of the current medical condition? Ask everyone in the room to speak. Also ask about the past 1-6 months—what has changed in terms of functional decline, weight loss, etc.
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>

          <ul>
           <li>
            Re-state: What would the patient say if they could speak? Ask: Have you ever discussed with the patient what he or she would want in a situation like this?

           <li>
            If you, as a clinician, have a firm opinion about the best plan of care, recommend it simply and explicitly, and explain why.

           <li>
            Try further discussion: What values is your decision based upon? How will the decision affect you and other family members?
