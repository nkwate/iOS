          Background
         </b>
         In the United States, the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB) pays for 80% of all hospice care. Established in 1983, the MHB pays for medical, nursing, counseling, and bereavement services to terminally ill patients and their families. The original goal of the MHB was to support families caring for a dying relative at home. Under certain circumstances, hospice services under the MHB can also be provided in a nursing home or the acute care hospital. Referral for hospice care is appropriate when the overall plan of care is directed toward comfort rather than reversing the underlying disease process.

          Eligibility—Medicare Hospice Benefit
         </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The patient must be entitled to Medicare Part A (hospital payments); once the patient decides to enter hospice care, they sign off Part A and sign on (elect) the MHB. Note: this process is reversible—patients may at a future time elect to return to Medicare Part A.
         </li>
         <li>
          The patient must be certified by the Hospice Medical Director and primary physician to have a life expectancy &lt; 6 months “if the patient's disease runs its natural course.” Patients can continue to be eligible if they live beyond 6 months as long as the physicians believe death is likely within 6 months.
         </li>
         <li>
          Under the MHB, DNR status cannot be used as a requirement for admission.

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Plan of Care (POC)
         </b>
         The hospice team and the patient’s physician work together to maximize quality of life by jointly developing the Plan of Care. The POC is based on the patient's diagnosis, symptoms, and other needs. The hospice program and the patient’s physician must together approve any proposed tests, treatments, and services. In general, only those treatments that are necessary for palliation and/or management of the terminal illness will be approved.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Physician Role
         </b>
         At the time of enrollment the patient indicates the primary physician who will direct care; the patient may select a hospice physician for this role or may select their usual primary doctor. The primary physician is responsible for working with the hospice team to determine appropriate care.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Non-Medicare Hospice Plans
         </b>
         Medicaid hospice benefits closely mirror the MHB. Private insurance plans generally emulate the MHB but occasionally depart from it dramatically (e.g. capping the total number of days a patient may receive hospice care).
